## Project Description

This project is a small demonstration of the CRUD operations of an application using SpecFlow. It illustrates how SpecFlow can be utilized to implement automated tests for these features. Similar to https://github.com/nourilee/demo which also demonstrates CRUD operations with Selenium and Java, this project focuses exclusively on the feasibility and effectiveness of using SpecFlow for similar testing tasks. Despite not being as popular among automation testers, SpecFlow proves to be a viable tool for creating and managing automated tests.

SpecFlow is less commonly chosen compared to Selenium, Playwright, and Cypress due to its steeper learning curve, focus on BDD (Behavior-Driven Development), and less extensive integration and community support. Selenium is widely adopted for its broad compatibility and robust community, while Playwright and Cypress offer modern features, faster test execution, and developer-friendly APIs. Key factors when choosing a test automation tool include project requirements, language compatibility, ease of use, community support, CI/CD integration, performance, cost, scalability, cross-browser/platform support, and reporting capabilities. These considerations help teams select the tool that best fits their project needs and constraints.
